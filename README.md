# Team-Tumbleweed-Data-Analysis.github.io
Team Tumbleweed's Github Page Repository, used for our team distribution map.

This repository directly hosts the map visible on https://team-tumbleweed-data-analysis.github.io/ from the index.html file, where we can see the distribution of our team over the world.

If anyone wants to update this map using newly entered location data in the [google docs file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/153QbEFOjmRF1UCk0KunOJQdZbnjYUYDd/edit#gid=1477209758), they can do so by replacing map.csv with
the newest version of the location data file. After this data has been updated, simply run all cells in the Map.ipynb file again and replace index.html with the newly generated one. 
The online map should then update in a few minutes!
